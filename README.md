# Sudoku-Solver

Better understanding backtracking with recursion and the pygame module by creating an algorithm which solves Sudoku.

## Running the app
To run the app, use pip to install the pygame library using the following command:
```pip install pygame```
Afterwards, run the python file SudokuGUI.py.

## Future plans
I am looking to work on creating a sudoku maker in the future, but it is not currently functional.
